# Essay Writing: Hands On

Try applying this structure to your own writing: write sentences for the corresponding elements of your introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion in the space provided below.

## Practice Introduction

*Begin your paper with a opening sentence or “hook” about your topic that catches the reader’s attention. Reference the list on the front for ideas.*

*Include context: provide the information the reader will need to understand the topic.*

*State your thesis, your arguably position on the topic. What side will you take? What will you prove in your paper? What are you going to explore?*

## Practice Body Paragraph

*Write a general topic sentence that states the main idea of the paragraph for your first body paragraph, or for one you are having difficulty organizing.*

*Write down the specific textual evidence or evidence from other sources that you are using to support your thesis.*

*Analyze your evidence: tell the reader what is significant or important about this evidence. How does the piece of evidence support your thesis? Why did you choose to include it?*

*Don’t forget a transition sentence: Connect each paragraph with a sentence or two that demonstrates how each idea leads into the next.*

## Practice Conclusion

*Make connections for the reader in your **conclusion**. You should refer back to your thesis, but don’t simply restate it. Use some of the following questions to guide you:*

- *Did you propose any solutions? Are there solutions yet to be discovered?*
- *What questions still need to be answered?*
- *What is the larger significance of the topic you chose to write about?*
- *What should the reader do or think after reading your paper?*
