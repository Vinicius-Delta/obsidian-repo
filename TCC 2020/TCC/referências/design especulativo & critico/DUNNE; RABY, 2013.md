"We coined the term critical design in the mid-nineties when we were researchers in the Computer Related Design Research Studio at the Royal College of Art. It grew out of our concerns with the uncritical drive behind technological progress, when technology is always assumed to be good and capable of solving any problem. our definition then was that "critical design uses speculative design proposals to challenge narrow assumptions, preconceptions, and givens about the role products play in everyday life."
